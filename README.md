# Proposal for implementing the collection of metrics 

As the Netherlands eScience Center grows, keeping track of all the things we do is becoming increasingly difficult. This is a problem, for example for:

1. Directors, who need to inform themselves about the state of the organization in order to steer the organization effectively, 
1. Program Managers, who need to know the history of projects,
1. Community Managers, who want to know what is being worked on,
1. Policy Advisors, who need to prepare various reports
1. etc.

This document outlines an approach for keeping track of various metrics. Some key points of the proposed approach are:

1. The list of what we want to keep track of is changable -- it will never be "done"
1. The implementation of how we track metrics is changable -- it will never be "done"
1. The successful implementation of the approach outlined below requires some technical skills, for example for querying APIs, meaningfully aggregating data, and presenting the data as visualizations, but also requires a good understanding of what is needed, for example with respect to which categories of the Self-Evaluation Protocol need to be covered, what the narratives will be for each of these, and how our efforts should be distributed over the various categories.

## General approach

When planning the project, the project stakeholders should discuss which metrics are meaningful to them given the nature of the project. A list of metrics will be provided. The list of metrics can be extended if needed--in fact, such change is expected, and the directors should encourage all employees to help create a meaningful collection covering all aspects of our work, both technical and non-technical. 

Based on the list, the project stakeholders can come to an agreement with the Program Managers, who will record the list of metrics. The project stakeholders and the Program Managers will periodically review the metrics document, making changes if needed. The list of metrics needs to be kept in a public place, preferably close to where the project output lives. This will help bring focus to the work being done in the project.

## How can people propose new metrics?

The preferred way of proposing a new metric is via GitHub's issue tracker. When making 
- make an issue
  - explain what the proposed metric is
  - explain why you think it adds to _our mission_
  - it's ok if you don't know how to measure something or if the proposed metric cannot be collected in an automated way


For a small set of people, making issues on GitHub is not convenient. For them, simply writing an email to the Program Managers with a description of the proposed idea is the best way; Program Managers can then make the issue instead. This ensures that there is a public record of what was proposed, as well as of the ensuing discussion, and ultimately of the decision on whether or not the proposal was added as a new metric.

## Who can propose new metrics?

In principle, anybody can propose new metrics, but the Program Managers will judge if a proposed metric is a meaningful addition to the existing list of metrics. In accepting a metric, the Program Managers must weigh the benefit of any new insights the proposed metric will bring against the cost of the required effort.
